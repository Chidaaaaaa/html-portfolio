<h1> the family </h1>
<p>Once upon a time, there lived a large family of many siblings who had all manner of diverse character traits humanity could ever imagine.
  They always moved in pairs, given their number. They had such a rapport with one another that none could come between them, 
  whether in good or bad times; through thick and thin, they learned to stick around for each other.</p>

<p>They lived during the colonial period, characterized by high moral and intellectual standards,
   and class distinction, where the rich got richer and the poor poorer. This social gap only grew wider as time went by.
    The peculiarity of this family was its size. They were known by a few rich folks but more widely amongst the commoners. 
    Having a large family at the time was perceived by the upper class as a characteristic of the poor.</p>

<p>They were considered commoners and peasant farmers, who spent more time in activities considered to be solely for the ordinary man and
   further characterized by high birth rates.
   Often these children served as work force in the farms, during times of war as soldiers,
   and as collateral for unpaid debts and pledges..</p>
   <p>Sixteen children were born to John Benedict Tates and Mary A. Tates, who belonged to the middle class.</p>
